AV.ITH (Digital pest remover)
==============

For my last coding project, I chose to do another interactive experience as I found fun in doing project 2, the web browser simulator. The experience is simple, yet a different concept of antivirus softwares from what we are used to for Windows users. In brief, this project intends to remake how we see and use an Antivirus software on a PC in an interactive way. To eradicate viruses on your computer, one must play a Tamagotchi game clone to reduce the latter's influence to be able to delete it easily afterwards.

My initial idea started around complex projects like a Guitar Hero clone from scratch and other stuff similar in complexity. Albeit the lack of time for such an adventure was a fact, I could not conceive doing one in only seven days. With a limited number of days to do this game, I did not want to go with very elaborate coding â€“ but even if it was not that complicated, I still had my share of problems showing now and then. And so, with simplicity in mind, the idea of a Tamagotchi came as the first choice. Still, I did not want it to be as simple and uncreative so I invented the concept described above. Plus, I found something fun in doing such an unconceived concept of how Antivirus softwares work. As humans in the era of Internet 2.0, (soon 3.0?), we crave for interactivity in our lives -- so why not make a boring task into something not so dull instead? I really think that maybe one day, boring and must-have softwares will be created to be more interactive with the user.

To boot, I tried to quickly give a fake Antivirus software identity to my project and a retro styling for the Tamagotchi like game along with trying to merge them so the project tries to look like the concept could be possible. Being comfortable with jQuery and ResponsiveVoice, I decided to go with these two JavaScript libraries. I also wanted to go with the jQuery UI Touch Punch library, but with the lack of time I had, I could not set out to use it. As I said earlier, I found quite some fun in doing project 2, a web browser simulator, so I tried to do something similar that possesses a bit of a linear interaction and narrative.

All in all, my interactive experiment going back on this whole idea of conceiving a new vision of how we use a normal and indispensable day to day software, I think that my project shows a facet companies and developers should consider exploiting in the near future.

People like interactivity and people dislike redundant tasks, so this idea is far from far fetched!
