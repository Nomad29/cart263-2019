This is a jQuery and Responsivevoice experience that intends to remake how we see and use an Antivirus on a PC in an interactive way. To eradicate virus on your computer, one must play to a tamagotchi game clone to reduce the latter's influence to be able to delete it easely.

The name of this interactive software is AV.ITH (Antivirus.Information Technology Helper)

Uses:
Responsive Voice
