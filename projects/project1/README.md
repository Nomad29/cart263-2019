For mere mortals, Sisyphus does not represent happiness for everybody. Even if we should believe, by the words of Albert Camus, that king Sisyphus is happy of his endless and divine punishment as well as the futility of it – not everybody on earth will be in the same state of mind as him. Some people could be pleased with repetitive situations like this, but others – like me – do not find the same pleasure in Sisyphean tasks.

Again, as Camus wrote, Sisyphus is no more than a metaphor for our struggle in our lives. Sentenced to an eternal task, without any chance of advancement nor success, Sisyphus still finds happiness by understanding and accepting its fate even if it is considered absurd. With this idea, my concept of *Scoopy’s Frenzy* pretty resembles a Sisyphean task because of its absurdness and the inevitable fact that the assignment will still be done even though it is futile.

With that perspective in mind, I had so much ideas and concept for this project that it took longer then expected to fulfill it. Since I was not able to make up my mind – because of the numerous Sisyphean daily tasks I have everyday and my love-hate relationship with them – I chose something easy with a humoristic tone. By creating a lighter feeling to something I, borderline, despise I was able to come up with something funny, yet a bit crude and childish. In short, the concept finally resulted with having to clean the never-ending mess of a very annoying neighbors’ dog. In fact, I chose a dog – even though in real life its a cat that we have trouble with – because I did not wanted to work on something unpleasant. In contrast, – with the help of jQuery and JQuery UI – I designed an uncomplicated interface with simple but joyful graphic elements and sounds to help relieve the crudeness as well as to bring out the humor.

As Friedrich Welcker once said, Sisyphus symbolise the vain struggle of man in the pursuit of knowledge. The simple remark was enough to confirm to me that my project was in the good direction, simply because it is a vain struggle to keep fighting or to gain knowledge on the subject – the animal will still lay waste on your front porch. The same concept was incorporated in *Scoopy’s Frenzy*. Not everything is a struggle if you learn to let go. Just as simple as the concept, in the game you can let go (finished the game) by letting the dog escape trough the window view so you do not have to clean after him anymore.

Of course, in real life, that is another story but one could hope.
