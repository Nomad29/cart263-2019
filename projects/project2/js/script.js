The Normality Simulator
Alexandra Melan√ßon
A fake browsing simulator on how people normally behave with a tool like the
World Wide Web at their fingertips. Sometimes, the searches are funny, but
they can also become rapidly twisted. To counter the spreading perversion of
the WWW, the authorities created the AI named BLACK BOX to control the
users in a not so distant future.


Uses:
Responsive Voice
